One very handy element in the Polymer ecosystem is the `core-pages` tag. It's a very simple element (it just toggles sections of content on and off for you) but it's really useful for putting together single page apps.

IMO, `core-pages` is best used on simple applications, and can be really nice when combined with a menu and router [using data-binding](http://robdodson.me/polycasts-08-auto-binding-templates-in-polymer/). I'll be diving into routers in the next couple of episodes of Polycasts so be sure to [subscribe to the Google Developers channel](https://www.youtube.com/user/GoogleDevelopers) if you want to receive updates when new episodes roll out.
