The power grid is a balancing act—there’s the amount that consumers are trying to use—the **demand**—and there’s the amount being generated by power plants—the **supply**.

Sometimes, like on the hottest day of the year when everyone is running their air conditioners, demand outpaces supply. During these times, the grid operator has to go to the energy market to buy more power to respond to the demand.

Depending on the situation, this might mean calling up a **peaker plant**. These are fast-acting—and very dirty—fossil fuel plants that can ramp-up quickly.

There are a number of problems with peaker plants:

1. They’re expensive to operate

   > A new report has found that New Yorkers over the last decade have paid more than \$4.5 billion in electricity bills to the private owners of the city’s peaker plants, just to keep those plants online in case they’re needed — even though they only operate between 90 and 500 hours a year.

2. They’re dirty

   > Many of these facilities are 50 or more years old, lack modern pollution controls, and run on dirty fuels like kerosene or oil at least part-time.

3. They damage the health of our communities
   > They're predominantly located near population centers where energy demands are greatest and typically located in communities of color and under-resourced areas. There are more than 1,000 peakers in operation across the country today, with the highest concentrations centered in and around major metropolitan areas. [source](https://www.usnews.com/news/cities/articles/2020-05-27/its-time-to-shut-down-polluting-urban-power-plants#:~:text=They%27re%20predominantly%20located,major%20metropolitan%20areas.)

Ironically, as we’ve moved from using fossil fuels to renewables like wind and solar, [some electric utilities have proposed building _more_ peaker plants](https://www.eenews.net/articles/fight-over-peaker-plants-poses-grid-climate-test/) to make up for the intermittent nature of renewables. This feels like a step backwards!

An alternative to peaker plants is that we could all agree to use less energy when the grid is under strain. But this presents a coordination problem: consumers don’t know when the grid is under strain, so they don’t know when to use less energy, and therefore grid operators cannot rely on these energy savings.

But a new group of startups are aiming to fix this coordination issue through a process called **demand response**.

## Demand response

As I mentioned earlier, the power grid is a balancing act. One way to balance the grid when demand is high is to generate more power. The other way is to lower demand, a.k.a. demand response.

> [...] demand response refers broadly to the ability and the willingness of retail electricity customers to adjust their consumption of electricity, based on wholesale price signals [source](https://www.westernenergy.org/news-resources/regulating-negawatts-how-does-the-federal-power-act-handle-non-sales-of-electricity/#:~:text=demand%20response%20refers%20broadly%20to%20the%20ability%20and%20the%20willingness%20of%20retail%20electricity%20customers%20to%20adjust%20their%20consumption%20of%20electricity%2C%20based%20on%20wholesale%20price%20signals)

In other words, if you and I agree to unplug our refrigerators for an hour when the grid is under strain, then we help rebalance the grid by lowering the demand.

Where this gets interesting is when you think about **aggregating that collective action**. Instead of unplugging one refrigerator for an hour, we unplug one million. Now we’re talking about _megawatts_ of power that can be “generated”, on-demand, to rebalance the grid.

Technically we're not generating new power, but the net effect is the same. If the grid needs one megawatt of power, and we turn off one megawatt’s worth of refrigerators, then the grid rebalances.

Rather than thinking of these as megawatts generated, you can instead think of them as **“negawatts”** saved (yes, that is an actual term used in the industry).

If we all knew when to turn off our refrigerators (or lights/thermostats/space heaters/air purifiers/EV chargers/etc.), and we understood energy markets well enough to sell energy into them, then we could act as a kind of **virtual power plant**. When a grid operator needs power, instead of going to a dirty peaker plant, they could instead call up our virtual power plant and **pay us** for our negawatts!

It might seem odd to think about selling energy that we _didn’t_ use, but according to the Federal Energy Regulatory Commission (FERC), we can do just that:

> In 2011, the Commission addressed compensation for demand response participation in Order No. 745. In that order, the Commission required each RTO and ISO to pay a demand response resource the market price for energy (locational marginal price or LMP) when the demand response resource can balance supply and demand as an alternative to a generation resource and dispatch of the demand response resource is cost-effective. [source](https://www.ferc.gov/industries-data/electric/power-sales-and-markets/demand-response#:~:text=In%202011%2C%20the,is%20cost%2Deffective.)

To do this sort of collective action, we need aggregators: someone to tell us when to reduce our energy consumption, who can handle selling that energy on our behalf. This is where startups like [Voltus](https://www.voltus.co/) and [OhmConnect](https://ohm.co/lets-email-rob) (to name a few) enter the picture. These companies present themselves as virtual power plants to grid operators and sell negawatts at a cost per kilowatt hour. They generate these negawatts by sending notifications to their users who then reduce their energy consumption during specific times. When Voltus or OhmConnect gets paid by the grid operator, they pass a percentage of that payment on to their users.

Voltus mostly targets industrial customers (steel mills, factories, etc.) but they told me that they plan to do more consumer demand response soon. OhmConnect, on the other hand, is entirely consumer facing and currently operates in California, Texas, and New York. I’ve been using OhmConnect since February 2022—about two months—and have so far earned around \$100 through a combination of energy savings and referrals.

## Changing how I think about the grid

If it isn’t already obvious, I find this model really interesting. By connecting a few smart devices to OhmConnect, and turning off unused lights when I get a notification, I am both earning money _and_ reducing CO2.

It has also changed the way that I think about the grid and my home. Previously, I thought of my home as being a one-way electricity consumer. Now I see it as more of a two-way relationship. We often hear about people with solar panels on their roofs being able to sell their excess power back into the grid—this is kind of like that, but for everyone, even folks who live in apartments.

Essentially everything in your home that uses power is a **distributed energy resource (DER)**. The more adaptable those DERs are to grid fluctuations, the smarter and more efficient the grid can be. So if you put your refrigerator on a smart plug (as I have) and connect it to OhmConnect, then it can be turned down for an hour at a time when the grid is strained, and you can be rewarded. Let's walk through an example!

## One OhmHour

When OhmConnect is tapped by a utility to sell negawatts, they will send you a notification with a specific time, an **OhmHour**, during which you should ramp-down your consumption. OhmHours typically occur once per week, and they notify you a day or so in advance, and then an hour before the event begins.

During the OhmHour you're rewarded in points—called **watts**—based on how much you reduce your consumption. Watts can be exchanged for cash (via PayPal), spent on discounted smart devices, or used for contests: free groceries for a year, an e-bike, that sort of thing. OhmConnect will also pay you cash for referring new users. It varies by state, but I earn $40 if I refer a fellow Californian, and the referee receives $10.

There’s no requirement to connect devices to OhmConnect—you can walk around your house and manually turn things off during an OhmHour—but I found it easier to let them do it for me, so I connected my Nest thermostat and a smart plug powering my refrigerator to my account. You can also choose to opt-out of an OhmHour and then your devices won’t be affected.

You're graded on how much energy you save compared to your previous 10-day average during that same time. For example, on March 16th from 7-8pm, I typically use 0.43kWh of energy, but during a recent OhmHour I reduced my consumption down to 0.19kWh.

![My OhmConnect dashboard showing an bar area chart comparing my typical 10-day usage versus my usage during the OhmHour. The chart shows a 57% reduction in power.](/images/ohmhour.jpg)

I didn't have to radically alter my life to achieve these savings. During this specific event, I was watching TV on the couch with my wife. But prior to the OhmHour starting I had turned off the unused lights in my house, and set my dishwasher on a timer so it would start later in the evening. My refrigerator automatically turned off and my thermostat switched to eco mode.

_Brief aside: Did you know that most dishwashers have a timed start feature? This is really helpful if, like me, you're on a peak time-of-use electricity plan!_

In total I earned 605 watts during that OhmHour: 245 watts in energy savings + 360 bonus watts for having two smart devices connected to my account (320 for my thermostat and 40 for my smart plug). Because you can use watts to buy more smart devices, which then grant additional watt bonuses, you can see how this turns into a sort of compounding system.

OhmConnect is clearly trying to gamify this process—apparently the CTO used to work at Zynga—so there are also streaks and levels which increase the discounts you receive when you exchange your watts for smart devices. You can also spend watts to increase your referral bonus, something I’ve done in the past before referring a few of my friends.

Does it feel a _tad_ like a multi-level marketing thing? Sure. But if you understand the whole demand response / virtual power plant model, you can see that they’re actually making money by selling negawatts to grid operators and paying you a percentage of that when you cash out your watts or use them to buy subsidized smart devices.

So it really is more of a social game where reducing CO2 is the goal and there are financial incentives. It's a novel approach to climate change because it takes the addictive engagement/recruitment model of Farmville but uses that power for good. Who would have ever thought that Farmville could help save the planet?

## Privacy concerns

I think it’s fair to mention that participating in OhmConnect does require sharing some data. For OhmConnect to work, it first needs to know how much energy you're using, which means giving them access to your energy data via your utility's website. In addition, you're rewarded for connecting smart devices to your account, which lets OhmConnect turn those devices off during an OhmHour.

I can totally understand being concerned about a third-party having the ability to turn off my refrigerator, but I actually _want them_ to have this ability. I’m very passionate about climate change and see this as a great way to do my part to help mitigate some of it.

As a Californian I’ve lived through several wildfire seasons. In the past few years, our utility, PG&E, has resorted to rolling blackouts to keep the grid from falling over. Blackouts mean people cannot use life saving medical devices or their air conditioners. This can potentially lead to deaths.

The way I see it, giving OhmConnect the ability to ramp-down my power consumption acts as a kind of backpressure model for the grid, so even if I’m not at home, my devices can quickly switch off and hopefully do a bit of good. Also, I’ve learned that an unopened refrigerator has enough thermal inertia to safely be off for around four hours 😄

But honestly, there's no lock-in, I can always opt-out of the OhmHour or just walk over and turn my refrigerator back on (or through my phone if I'm not at home). Since you're only rewarded based on your energy savings, if you choose to completely ignore the OhmHour there's no real penalty, you just won't earn any watts.

## Give it a shot!

If you’re interested in trying OhmConnect you can use [my referral](https://ohm.co/lets-email-rob) and we’ll both get some money 🙌 When you first sign up they will offer to send you a smart plug for $1. Technically you have to pay the full $11 and then they refund you \$10 if you connect the device to your account (I can verify that they did refund me).

If you want to learn more about their business I recommend checking out the [My Climate Journey interview with their CEO, Cisco DeVries](https://my-climate-journey.simplecast.com/episodes/cisco-devries).

I should also mention that both OhmConnect and Voltus are hiring!
