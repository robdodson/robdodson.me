I'm always fascinated learning the little productivity tricks that people use.

## First, a bit about me

I currently work on two content sites at Google, [web.dev](https://web.dev) and [developer.chrome.com](https://developer.chrome.com). I also manage a geographically distributed team of three engineers who sit in the Bay Area, Sydney, and Zurich. Time zones are my enemy. ‚è∞

I spend most of my day either helping authors in our team chat, jumping between GitHub projects, in meetings üòµ, or planning "What's next" for our team. When things are going well and I'm being organized my workflow and tooling looks something like this:

## Todoist

I've tried a lot of project management tools‚Äîand at Google we have some of our own‚Äîbut since I work across projects it means my tasks are between GitHub issues, various kanban boards, and spreadsheets.

What I found helpful about Todoist is that I can give _myself_ a personal project management tool, which acts as a layer on top of all of the other tools I use.

Todoist has a lot of features but I only use a handful of them: priorities, scheduled tasks, and project boards.

**Priorities** let me quickly dash out if I think a task is a `p1` (very important) or a `p3` (less important) and Todoist will color code and sort them accordingly.

**Scheduled tasks** let me file an idea away for later.

For example, if I write "Wash the dog **tomorrow**", it will move the task out of my view and tuck it away until tomorrow.

Recently Todoist added kanban style **project boards**, which didn't interest me at first because I like the simple list view. But I realized I could use priorities and scheduled tasks as project subtasks and get the best of both worlds. If I have a big project I'll create a card for it and break it into scheduled subtasks, when the date arrives the subtask gets added to my **Today** list.

If you're interested in giving Todoist a try you can use [this referral code](https://todoist.com/r/rob_dodson_vloaey) and I'll get a few months for free ü§ù

## Pinboard

Pinboard is a minimalist bookmark tracker. It sort of looks like Craigslist.

It has a simple browser extension you can use to bookmark something and assign it tags. Then, months or weeks later, you can go back to your pinboard and track it down again.

Combining Todoist and Pinboard leads me to my first productivity win:

## Aggressively close Chrome tabs

If I have more than a handful of Chrome tabs open I start to get overwhelmed. I know folks often have a hard time closing their tabs but I've found having a combination of a good todo list and a bookmark list helps me mentally file stuff away for later. If it's important I'll assign it a task and either drop the link in the task as a comment or pin it.

Then I close the tab. üíÜ‚Äç‚ôÇÔ∏èüíÜ‚Äç‚ôÇÔ∏èüíÜ‚Äç‚ôÇÔ∏è

One tip is to use **pinned tabs** in Chrome for things that you leave open all day like GMail, chat, or calendars.
Here's what my tab bar usually looks like:
