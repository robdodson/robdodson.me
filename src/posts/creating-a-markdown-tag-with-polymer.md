Ah Markdown... Such an amazing tool. I honestly would not be writing this blog post if Markdown did not exist. I tried many times to get in to blogging but I always found the writing experience, whether it be in a GUI or WordPress' HTML mode, too limiting. Markdown changed all of that for me and I think it's high time we make it a full fledged member of our developer toolbox.

So today I'm going to show you how to build a Markdown tag using [Polymer, a Web Components framework from Google.](http://www.polymer-project.org/)

## Github

[If you'd like to follow along you can grab the code from Github.](https://github.com/robdodson/mark-down)

## The Setup

First things first, we need to download the latest version of Polymer. I like to do this with [bower](http://bower.io) and I would encourage you to do so as well. Although it hasn't been discussed much, I think bower is going to be as important to web components as npm and the node_modules folder is to Node.js. When developers can assume the location and version of a dependency then they're able to remove extra work from the consumer's plate. But that's a discussion for another day! For now let's just run

```bash
bower init
```

to create our `bower.json` file.

And we'll want to install our Polymer and Markdown dependencies so

```bash
bower install Polymer/polymer marked --save
```

Lastly we'll setup a test page for our element. I'm going to assume that the element lives in a folder called (creatively) `elements` so we'll import from there.

```html
<!DOCTYPE html>
<html lang="en">
  <head>
    <meta charset="utf-8">
    <title>Markdown Polymer Element</title>
    <!-- Include webcomponents.js to polyfill web components in old browsers -->
    <script src="bower_components/webcomponentsjs/webcomponents.js"></script>

    <!-- Import our polymer element -->
    <link rel="import" href="elements/mark-down.html">
  </head>
  <body>
    <!-- Test our awesome new tag -->
    <mark-down></mark-down>
  </body>
</html>
```

## The Element

We'll start with a very basic skeleton in our `elements/mark-down.html` file.

```html
<link rel="import" href="../polymer/polymer.html">
<polymer-element name="mark-down">
  <template>
    <div id="markdown"></div>
  </template>
  <script>
    Polymer({

    });
  </script>
</polymer-element>
```

Let's walk through this a bit.

```html
<polymer-element name="mark-down">
```

This line tells Polymer that we'd like to define a new element and its tag name should be `mark-down`.

```html
<template>
  <div id="markdown"></div>
</template>
```

This is our template which Polymer will convert to [Shadow DOM.](/blog/2013/08/26/shadow-dom-introduction/) All of the Markdown that we write inside of the `<mark-down>` tag will be parsed and end up here.

```html
<script>
  Polymer({

  });
</script>
```

Finally, we call the Polymer constructor and pass in a prototype object. This makes our new tag available so we can start using it in the document. But first we'll need to parse our Markdown into HTML!

## Markdown

We'll use Polymer's [`ready` callback](http://www.polymer-project.org/docs/polymer/polymer.html#lifecyclemethods) to grab the `textContent` of our tag and convert it all to Markdown. To define behaviors for our element we'll modify our prototype object (the object passed to the Polymer constructor).

```js
Polymer({
  ready: function() {
    var content = this.trim(this.textContent);
    var parsed = markdown.toHTML(content);
    this.$.markdown.innerHTML = parsed;
  },
  // Remove excess white space
  trim: function() { ... }
});
```

The first thing we do is to grab everything inside of the `<mark-down>` tag and remove any extra white space. Here I'm using a trim method that I borrowed from [Ryan Seddon's Markdown element.](https://github.com/ryanseddon/markdown-component) Big thanks to Ryan :D

```js
ready: function() {
  var content = this.trim(this.textContent);
  ...
},
```

Next we convert the content into Markdown using the `toHTML` method of our Markdown library. Then we take this new, more presentational markup, and add it to the `#markdown` div inside of our `template`.

```js
ready: function() {
  ...
  var parsed = markdown.toHTML(content);
  this.$.markdown.innerHTML = parsed;
}
```

### Node Finding

You might notice the funny use of `$` and think I'm doing something clever with jQuery. What's actually happening is that Polymer creates a map of any element inside of our template with an `id`. It then stores this map in a `$` property. So if you're using ids you can quickly access elements with the use of `this.$.someId`. In the Polymer docs this is referred to as [automatic node finding.](http://www.polymer-project.org/getting-started.html#automatic-node-finding)

*But aren't ids an anti-pattern?*

Although the traditional document model only allows for one id per page, the Shadow DOM creates a kind of clean slate where each element has its own id sandbox. This means we can use an id of `#markdown` in our element and not worry if the parent document also contains an element with id `#markdown`. Pretty nifty!

## Test

The only thing left is for us to throw some Markdown into our tag to test it out.

```html
<mark-down>
  # This is a heading
  ## This is a subheading

  Here is **more** _Markdown!_

  `This is some codez`

  This [is a link](http://robdodson.me)
</mark-down>
```

Piece O' Cake!

## Moar!

There's a lot more that we could do, for instance, using something like `contenteditable` to allow us to toggle back and forth between the source and the rendered content. [I've posted the code on Github](https://github.com/robdodson/mark-down) so fork it and go crazy.

Till next time!
