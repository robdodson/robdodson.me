I want to work on a code generation tool, similar to the one offered up by Rails. However my Ruby-fu is a bit rusty at the moment so this might be an interesting struggle.

The first thing I'm going to do is create a new gemset with rvm. Our gem is going to be called `r2` after the much beloved R2D2 so we'll also call our gemset `r2`.

    rvm gemset create r2
    rvm use 1.9.3@r2
    

Ugh after spending about an 2 hours fucking around with bundler I'm getting nowhere. I'll have to pick this up tomorrow. :\ #WorstPostEver
