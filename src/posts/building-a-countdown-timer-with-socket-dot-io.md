Yesterday I put together a very simple Node/Socket.io application and showed how to deploy it to Heroku. Today I'm going to keep going with that app to see if I can get the functionality that I want. The app is a basic stopwatch so that shouldn't be too hard. If you want to catch up [checkout yesterday's article](http://robdodson.me/blog/2012/06/04/deploying-your-first-node-dot-js-and-socket-dot-io-app-to-heroku/) which explains setting everything up.

### Countdown

Just to get the ball rolling I'm going to write a little code in my `app.js` file right at the bottom to setup a very crude counter.

    var countdown = 1000;
    setInterval(function() {
      countdown--;
      io.sockets.emit('timer', { countdown: countdown });
    }, 1000);
    
    io.sockets.on('connection', function (socket) {
      socket.on('reset', function (data) {
        countdown = 1000;
        io.sockets.emit('timer', { countdown: countdown });
      });
    });
    

Elsewhere in my client-side js I'm going to listen for the `timer` event and update my DOM elements.

    var socket = io.connect(window.location.hostname);
    
    socket.on('timer', function (data) {
        $('#counter').html(data.countdown);
    });
    
    $('#reset').click(function() {
        socket.emit('reset');
    });
    

You'll also need to update your index.ejs file so it reads like this:

    <div id="counter"></div>
    <button id="reset">Reset!</button>
    

Every second we'll decrement our countdown variable and broadcast its new value. If a client sends us a `reset` event we'll restart the timer and immediately broadcast the update to anyone connected. I noticed that since I'm using `xhr-polling` it can sometimes take a while for the timer to show up in my browser so keep that in mind.

While this implementation isn't pretty it does get us a little bit further down the road. Unfortunately I've been tripped up by a bunch of Node's module issues so I have to cut tonight's post short :\

Hopefully better luck tomorrow. - Rob
