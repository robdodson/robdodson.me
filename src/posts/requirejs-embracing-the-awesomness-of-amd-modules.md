title: RequireJS -- Embracing the Awesomness of AMD Modules
description: >
  Over the past few weeks I put together this talk for my team at GE to help get 
  everyone on the same page with AMD modules. I figured it'd be cool if I removed
  any GE specific stuff and open sourced the presentation, so here it is!

Over the past few weeks I put together this talk for my team at GE to help get
everyone on the same page with AMD modules. I figured it'd be cool if I removed
any GE specific stuff and open sourced the presentation, [so here it is](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vWGuaZOTR4U&ab_channel=RobDodson)!

The video is around 35 minutes long and there's a slide deck available on Github
that has clickable links and whatnot. Enjoy!
