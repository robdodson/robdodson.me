Yesterday I tried to do a post on creating your first Ruby Gem as a command line tool. [It didn't go very well.](http://robdodson.me/blog/2012/06/12/messing-around-with-gems/) In an effort to better understand what goes on with command line tools I'm going to start from the most basic, a ruby script that is in our `PATH`.

I've previously added the folder `~/bin` to my PATH so I know that if I drop an executable script in there I should be able to run it by just typing its name. Let's give that a shot. First we'll make a new file just called `sherp` without any file extension. Make sure to `chmod 755 sherpa` so that it's executable. Then we'll add the following:

    #!/usr/bin/env ruby
    
    puts 'I am the sherpa!!!'
    

If I now type `sherpa` into the command line, it should fire back `I am the sherpa!!!`

Ok cool so we've got that part working. Now let's see if we can get some arguments in there. We'll iterate the `ARGV` object to see what comes in.

    #!/usr/bin/env ruby
    
    ARGV.each do |arg|
        puts arg
    end
    

With that little bit of code we should be able to pass just about anything to our command and have it echoed back.

    sherpa foo bar baz
    
     => foo
     => bar
     => baz
    

Ok cool. Now let's step this up a notch or two. Let's say we want to send in commands and options. For that we'll use the built-in [OptionParser](http://ruby-doc.org/stdlib-1.9.3/libdoc/optparse/rdoc/OptionParser.html). Here's [a link to the article I've been following which details how to use the OptionParser.](http://rubylearning.com/blog/2011/01/03/how-do-i-make-a-command-line-tool-in-ruby/) In my case, I'm going to tell `sherpa` to either `say_hello` or `say_goodbye`. When I pass in the `-n` flag it should accept a name, otherwise it will use the name 'Master'. So the line `sherpa say_hello -n Rob` should produce `Hello Rob` and likewise if I left off the option and just used `sherpa say_hello` it should produce `Hello Master`.

Here's the code to accomplish this:

    #!/usr/bin/env ruby
    
    require 'optparse'
    
    options = {}
    
    opt_parser = OptionParser.new do |opt|
      opt.banner = "Usage: opt_parser COMMAND [OPTIONS]"
      opt.separator  ""
      opt.separator  "Commands"
      opt.separator  "     name: the name the sherpa should use when addressing you"
      opt.separator  ""
      opt.separator  "Options"
    
      opt.on("-n","--name NAME","tell the sherpa what to call you") do |name|
        options[:name] = name
      end
    
      opt.on("-h","--help","help") do
        puts opt_parser
      end
    end
    
    opt_parser.parse!
    name = options[:name] || 'Master'
    
    case ARGV[0]
    when "say_hello"
      puts "Hello #{name}"
    when "say_goodbye"
      puts "Goodbye #{name}"
    else
      puts opt_parser
    end
    

And there we go, our first command line Ruby tool. I'll pick it up tomorrow to try to improve upon it. We're starting small but at least we have something that works!
