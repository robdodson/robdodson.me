Finally managed to get [v0.7 of the Polymer Yeoman generator](https://github.com/yeoman/generator-polymer/releases/tag/v0.7.0) out. This release includes Gulp support, BrowserSync, and a sweet little Material Design scaffold to get people started.

This release took a while to put together but I'm really happy to finally have it out there. It's my first time working with Gulp and it was quite the learning experience. If you have issues please be sure to open a thread over on [the GitHub tracker](https://github.com/yeoman/generator-polymer/issues).

Enjoy!
